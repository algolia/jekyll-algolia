Introduction text that also includes [some link](https://www.algolia.com). To
add a bit of fancy, we will also __bold__ and _italicize_ some text.

# Main title

We like writing stuff and then indexing it in a very fast engine. Here is why
a fast engine is good for you:

* fast
* fast
* fast
* and fast

## Built with hands

All this text was typed with my own hands, on my own keyboard. I also did use
a Chair© and a Table™.

## Features

The whole plugin is composed of parts of `code`, and sometime even
<code>&lt;code&gt;</code>.

Code is __✔ checked__ and errors are __✘ deleted__.
