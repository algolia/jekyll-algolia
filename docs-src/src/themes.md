# Themes

The [tutorial][1]  explains how to update the default Jekyll theme ([minima][2])
to allow searching into all posts. You should be able to follow similar steps
to add search into your own design.

Some themes already have `jekyll-algolia` embedded by default:

- [Minimal Mistakes][3], by [@mmistakes][4]
- [GaeBlogx][5], by [@SeraphRoy][6]
- [Sakura][7] ([live demo][8]), by [@kimfucious][9]
- [tactile-advanced-template][10]

## Add your own

If you're maintaining a theme using `jekyll-algolia`, feel free to [edit this
page][11] to add your theme to the list.
