# Options

The plugin should work out of the box for most websites, but there are options
you can tweak if needed. All the options should be added under the `algolia`
section of your `_config.yml` file.

You should be familiar with [how this plugin works][1] under
the hood to better understand what some options are doing.

## `extensions_to_index`

This options defines which source files should be indexed, based on their file
extension. If an extension is not in the list, then the file will not be
indexed.

By default, all HTML and markdown source files will be indexed.

If you are using another markup language (such as [AsciiDoc][2] or [Textile][3]),
you might want to update the value like this:

```yml
algolia:
  # Also index AsciiDoc and Textile files
  extensions_to_index: 'html,md,adoc,textile'
```

## `files_to_exclude`

This option lets you define a blacklist of source files you don't want to index.

By default it will exclude all the `index.html` and `index.md` files. Those
files are usually not containing much text (landing pages) or containing
redundant text (latest blog articles) so they are not included by default.

If you want to index those files, you should set the value to an empty array.

```yml
algolia:
  # Actually index the index.html/index.md pages
  files_to_exclude: []
```

If you want to exclude more files, you should add them to the array. Note that
you can use glob patterns to exclude several files at once.

```yml
algolia:
  # Exclude more files from indexing
  files_to_exclude:
    - index.html
    - index.md
    - excluded-file.html
    - _posts/2017-01-20-date-to-forget.md
    - subdirectory/*.html
```

_Note that some files (pagination pages, static assets, etc) will **always** be
excluded and you don't have to specify them._

## `nodes_to_index`

This options defines how each page is split into chunks. It expects
a CSS selector that will be applied on the HTML content generated by Jekyll.
Each matching node will be indexed as a different record.

The default value is `p`, meaning that one record will be created for each `<p>`
paragraph of content.

If you would like to index other elements, like `<blockquote>`, `<li>` or
a custom `<div class="paragraph">`, you should edit the value like this:

```yml
algolia:
  # Also index quotes, list items and custom paragraphs
  nodes_to_index: 'p,blockquote,li,div.paragraph'
```

## `settings`

This option let you pass specific settings to your Algolia index.

By default the plugin will configure your Algolia index with settings tailored
to the format of the extracted records. You are of course free to overwrite
them or configure them as best suits your needs. Every option passed to the
`settings` entry will be set as [setting to your index][4].

For example if you want to change the HTML tag used for the highlighting, you
can overwrite it like this:

```yml
algolia:
  settings:
    highlightPreTag: '<em class="custom_highlight">'
    highlightPostTag: '</em>'
```

Settings defined here will take precedence over any setting you manually defined
through the [Algolia dashboard][5] UI, though.

## `indexing_batch_size`

This option defines the number of operations that will be grouped as part of one
updating batch. All operations of one batch are applied atomically. The default
value is `1000`.

You might want to increase this value if you are doing a lot of updates on each
run and still want to have your changes done atomically.

You might want to decrease this value if you're using an unstable internet
connection. Smaller batches are easier to send that large ones.

```yml
algolia:
  # Send fewer records per batch
  indexing_batch_size: 500
```
