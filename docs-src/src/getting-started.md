# Getting started

## Welcome to jekyll-algolia

`jekyll-algolia` is a Jekyll plugin that lets you push all your content in an
Algolia index.

## Requirements

You'll need:

- [Jekyll][1] >= 3.6.0
- [Ruby][2] >= 2.3.0
- [Bundler][3]

## Installation

You need to add `jekyll-algolia` to your `Gemfile`, as part of the
`:jekyll-plugins` group. If you do not yet have a Gemfile, here is the minimal
content you'll need:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'jekyll', '~> 3.6'

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-algolia'
end
```

Then, run `bundle install` to update your dependencies.

If everything went well, you should be able to run `jekyll help` and see the
`algolia` subcommand listed.

## Configuration

You need to provide your Algolia credentials for this plugin to *index* your
site.

*If you don't yet have an Algolia account, you can open a free [Community plan
here][4]. Once signed in, you can get your credentials from
[your dashboard][5].*

Once you have your credentials, you should define your `application_id` and
`index_name` inside your `_config.yml` file like this:

```yaml
# _config.yml

algolia:
  application_id: 'your_application_id'
  index_name:     'your_index_name'
```

## Usage

Once your credentials are setup, you can run the indexing by running the
following command:

```shell
ALGOLIA_API_KEY='{your_admin_api_key}' bundle exec jekyll algolia
```

Note that `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` should be set to your admin API key. This key has
write access to your index so will be able to push new data. This is also why
you have to set it on the command line and not in the `_config.yml` file: you
want to keep this key secret and not commit it to your versioning system.

![jekyll algolia command example][6]

_Note that in the animation we simplified the method call to `jekyll algolia` by using an
[alternative way][7] of loading the API key and using [rubygems-bundler][8] to
remove the need to add `bundle exec`._

## Front-end

The plugin only takes care of extracting your data and pushing it to an Algolia
index. Building the front-end that will allow your users to search into that
data is not part of the plugin.

As it would depend too much on the theming you applied to Jekyll, we could not
create a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, the best solution is to use our
[InstantSearch.js][9] library (also available for [Vue.js][10] and [React][11]).
It's an easy-to-use set of UI widgets you can use to build your own search in
a matter of minutes.

You can follow [this tutorial][12] to see how to add search on the default blog
theme.
