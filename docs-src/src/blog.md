# Blog search

The default Jekyll theme ([minima][1]) is perfect for writing a blog. Let's see how
to edit this theme to allow searching into all the posts.

This tutorial will be focused on the front-end part, and assumes that you
already have pushed all your data, following our [getting started][2] guide.

## What we'll build

[![Search in the minima theme][3]](https://community.algolia.com/jekyll-algolia-example/)

In this tutorial we'll add a search on the front page that will let you search
into all your posts (both titles and content), in a fast and relevant manner.

## Extending the theme

Because the `minima` is pre-packaged as a dependency, if you want to edit it,
you need to overwrite some of its files locally. For this tutorial, we'll
need to update [one file][4] from the original theme.

```html
---
layout: default
---

<div class="home">

  {{ content }}

  <h1 class="page-heading">Posts</h1>

  <div id="search-searchbar"></div>

  <div class="post-list" id="search-hits">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <div class="post-item">
        {% assign date_format = site.minima.date_format | default: "%b %-d, %Y" %}
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: date_format }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">
            {{ post.title | escape }}
          </a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-snippet">{{ post.excerpt }}</div>
      </div>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>

  {% include algolia.html %}

  <p class="rss-subscribe">subscribe <a href="{{ '/feed.xml' | relative_url }}">via RSS</a></p>

</div>
```

This file should be saved to `_layouts/home.html` in your own Jekyll directory.
You might have to create the `_layouts` folder if it does not yet exist.

## Adding front-end code

We'll now create the `_includes/algolia.html` file that we included in the
previous code. You'll have to create the `_includes` directory if it does not
exist yet.

In that file, we'll add the following content. It's a lot of code in one go, but
don't worry, we'll explain it all right after.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@2.3.3/dist/instantsearch.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@2.3.3/dist/instantsearch.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@2.3.3/dist/instantsearch-theme-algolia.min.css">

<script>
// Instanciating InstantSearch.js with Algolia credentials
const search = instantsearch({
  appId: '{{ site.algolia.application_id }}',
  indexName: '{{ site.algolia.index_name }}',
  apiKey: '{{ site.algolia.search_only_api_key }}'
});

// Adding searchbar and results widgets
search.addWidget(
  instantsearch.widgets.searchBox({
    container: '#search-searchbar',
    placeholder: 'Search into posts...'
  })
);
search.addWidget(
  instantsearch.widgets.hits({
    container: '#search-hits'
  })
);

// Starting the search
search.start();
</script>
```

### Including the InstantSearch.js library

The first lines will include the [InstantSearch.js][5] library as well as
minimal styling, directly from the jsDeliver CDN. Those files are also available
through [Yarn][6]/[NPM][7] if you need them locally.

### Instanciating the library

Then we instanciate `instantsearch` with our Algolia credentials. We use the `{{
}}` notation here to include variables that are defined in your `_config.yml`
file.

Both `application_id` and `index_name` should already be in your `_config.yml`
file. The `search_only_api_key` should be new, though.

Add a new entry in your `_config.yml` file, under the `algolia` namespace with
the value of your Search API Key (you can find it in your [Dashboard][8]):

```yml
# _config.yml
algolia:
   application_id: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID
   index_name: YOUR_INDEX_NAME
   search_only_api_key: YOUR_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY
```

### Adding widgets

InstantSearch.js lets you build your search UI through widgets. Each part of the
UI is a specific widget, and all widgets are kept in sync at all time.

For this example we'll need two widgets: a searchbar, and a list of results. The
mandatory configuration for each widget is the `container` option. It defines where
in the page the widget should be placed.

The searchbar will be added inside the `#search-searchbar` empty `<div>`. The
results will be added inside `#search-hits`. This `<div>` already contains the
static list of posts Jekyll added, but it's not an issue. When the page will
load, the static list from Jekyll will be displayed, but as soon as
InstantSearch loads, it will replace the list with its own results.

### What it looks like for now

This is what it should look like at this stage. We have a search bar, but
results are displayed in a raw JSON format. Let's work on styling this.

![Minimal InstantSearch.js styling][9]

## Templating

We'll add some templating to the result, so they look like regular posts. We use
the `templates.item` key of the widget for that. It accepts a function that will
take the matching `hit` (the result) as input, and should return an HTML string.

We'll re-use a similar markup than the one used in the original Liquid template.


```javascript
search.addWidget(
  instantsearch.widgets.hits({
    container: '#search-hits',
    templates: {
      item: function(hit) {
        return `
          <div class="post-item">
            <span class="post-meta">${hit.date}</span>
            <h2><a class="post-link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}${hit.url}">${hit.title}</a></h2>
            <div class="post-snippet">${hit.html}</div>
          </div>
        `;
      }
    }
  })
);
```

![InstantSearch.js styling][10]

This looks much better already. By using a template, we managed to make the
result look close to what the initial display was. In the next section, we'll
fix the styling and formatting.

## Styling

### Formatting the date

One of the first issues you can notice is that the date is not formatted. By
default we display it exactly as it was saved in the Algolia index: as a UNIX
timestamp.

Because our template is a JavaScript function, we can reformat data before
rendering it. Here we will use the [moment.js][11]
library to format our date.

Using `moment.unix(hit.date).format('MMM D, YYYY');` we'll transform
`1513764761` into `Dec 20, 2017`.

### Adding highlighting

To make the display even easier to understand, we should add some highlighting:
words typed in the search bar should be highlighted in the results.

Results returned by the Algolia API are enriched with a `_highlightResult` key
that contain information about the highlighting.

Adding highlighting is as easy as using `{{hit._highlightResult.title.value}}`
instead of `{{title}}`.

### Adding CSS

We're almost done, but we still have some minor styling adjustment to make. We
want the search bar to take the whole width, and we also want to add some
spacing between the results. We'll also change the color of the highlighted
words so they are easier to spot.

All HTML nodes added by InstantSearch.js come with a custom `.ais-*` class added
to them. This makes altering the styling of the elements to match your overall
theme easy to achieve.

### Edge-case handling

With the current configuration, we will sometimes end up with results that look
irrelevant: nothing is highlighted neither in the title or the content.

This is because by default the plugin is searching into different fields
(including `tags`, `categories` and the parent heading hierarchy of each
paragraph). Because we chose to only display the title and content, it means that
when a match in another attribute is occurring, we have no way to visually signal
it to the user. It makes the result look irrelevant, while it is actually
relevant (but we're not explaining why).

One way to work around this issue is to manually tell the API in which field it
should search, by using the `[restrictSearchableAttributes][12]` option.

### Final code

Here is the complete new version of the `_includes/algolia.html` file.

<script>
const search = instantsearch({

  indexName: '{{ site.algolia.index_name }}',
  searchParameters: {
    restrictSearchableAttributes: [
      'title',
      'content'
    ]
  }
});

const hitTemplate = function(hit) {
  const date = moment.unix(hit.date).format('MMM D, YYYY');
  const url = hit.url;
  const title = hit._highlightResult.title.value;
  const content = hit._highlightResult.html.value;

  return `
    <div class="post-item">
      <span class="post-meta">${date}</span>
      <h2><a class="post-link" href="${url}">${title}</a></h2>
      <div class="post-snippet">${content}</div>
    </div>
  `;
}


search.addWidget(
  instantsearch.widgets.searchBox({
    container: '#search-searchbar',
    placeholder: 'Search into posts...'
  })
);

search.addWidget(
  instantsearch.widgets.hits({
    container: '#search-hits',
    templates: {
      item: hitTemplate
    }
  })
);

search.start();
</script>

<style>
.ais-search-box {
  max-width: 100%;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
}
.post-item {
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}
.post-link .ais-Highlight {
  color: #111;
  font-style: normal;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
.post-snippet .ais-Highlight {
  color: #2a7ae2;
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
```
