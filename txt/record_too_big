Algolia Error: Record too big
  Records pushed to Algolia have a max possible size of 10KB. Records above this
  limit will be rejected.

  You see this error because at least one of the records the plugin is trying to
  push is above this limit.
  
  The plugin creates a record for each `<p>` paragraph of text found in your
  pages. If one of them contains a huge chunk of text it may trigger this error.

  You can configure the CSS selector used to create records through the
  `record_css_selector` option. The default is `p` (meaning all `<p>`
  paragraphs). You can update this value to use a negation selector to exclude
  some parts.

  For example `p:not(.do-not-index)` will only index paragraphs that do not have
  the class `do-not-index`.
